## Developing Tutorials

### Run the server locally to preview your work

First, check out this repository, install dependencies, and run the dev server locally:

```sh
> npm install
> npm run serve
```
You should now be able to preview your work in a web browser at: http://localhost:3000/#/

(Note that you won't be able to see your new lessons until you've updated the appropriate routes and import statements, as described below.)

### Create a directory for your tutorial

Each tutorial in ProtoSchool has a 4-digit ID and a corresponding directory. To determine the right ID for your new tutorial, first navigate to the `tutorials` directory and list its contents:


```sh
> cd src/tutorials
> ls
0001
0002
0003
0004
boilerplates
```
The number used as your tutorial's ID and directory name should be one higher than the last numbered directory you see listed. (In the example above, seeing that `0004` is the last numbered directory, you would create a new directory called `0005`.)

Create a directory with the appropriate ID, for example:

```sh
> mkdir 0005
```

### Build your lessons (repeat for each lesson in the tutorial)

Each **tutorial** in ProtoSchool is made up of multiple **lessons**.

Currently there are three lesson formats available, which you may mix and match within your tutorial:
- A standard lesson with a coding exercise (the most common)
- A lesson with a coding exercise that requires a file upload
- A text-only lesson with no code challenge

Follow the steps below to create each lesson.

#### Create lesson files

Depending on which lesson format you've chosen, you'll need to create 2-4 files within your project directory. Check the table below to see which files you need, then read on for instructions on how to create them.

| File | Sample Filename | Standard Lesson with Coding Exercise | Lesson with Coding Exercise and File Upload | Multiple-Choice Lesson | Text-Only Lesson
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| A Vue file that provides **required metadata** (e.g. code) for your lesson and, when relevant, the **default code and validation for a coding exercise** or **answer selections for multiple-choice quizzes** |`01.vue`| Required | Required | Required | Required |
| A markdown file containing the **text of the lesson** (your educational content)|`01.md`| Required | Required | Required | Required |
| A markdown file containing the **text of the assignment shown in the exercise box**|`01-exercise.vue`| Required | Required | Not Used | Not Used |
| A markdown file containing the **text of the optional useful concepts box**|`01-concepts.md`| Optional | Optional | Optional | Optional |

In the example below, four files stored in the `tutorial/0005` directory work together to create the second lesson in that tutorial.

![screenshot](public/lesson_sources.png)

Not familiar with markdown? It's a fairly simple way to style text on the web. [Learn more about markdown formatting here.](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

Not familiar with Vue? No worries, we'll be providing the details you need to use it within this project. You _will_ need to use some JavaScript, though, as you build your default code and validation.

##### Vue file

Select the appropriate boilerplate Vue file for your lesson from the `tutorials/boilerplates` directory:

- `boilerplate-standard.vue` for a lesson with a coding exercise which does not require a file upload
- `boilerplate-file-upload.vue` for a lesson with a coding exercise that requires a file upload
- `boilerplate-multiple-choice.vue` for a lesson with a multiple-choice quiz
- `boilerplate-no-exercise.vue` for a text-only lesson

Copy that boilerplate into the tutorial directory you created earlier (e.g. `0005`) and rename it to the 2-digit number of the lesson.

For example, to create a Vue file for a standard coding exercise as Lesson 01 of Tutorial 0005 (while still in `src/tutorials`):

```sh
> cp boilerplates/boilerplate-standard.vue 0005/01.vue
```

Replace anything in the boilerplate file that reads "REPLACEME" with the 2-digit lesson number.

If your lesson includes a coding exercise, you'll also use this file to set up your default code and validation, as described later in these instructions.

##### Lesson text file (with optional images)

Create a `.md` file alongside your `.vue` and add the markdown-formatted text
of the lesson itself (your educational content). The name of this file should match the 2-digit lesson number used
in the corresponding Vue file.

For example (for Lesson 01 of Tutorial 0005):

```
src/tutorials/0005/01.md
```

If you want to add images to your markdown file, place them in the `public/tutorial-assets` directory, with the following naming convention (you'll use a similar convention when creating the lesson components in the router):

`T<4-digit-tutorial-id>L<2-digit-lesson-number>-<imageName>`, such as `T0001L05-dag.svg`.

Then in your lesson markdown file, you can either add it with regular markdown:

```
![Description of the image](tutorial-assets/T0001L01-dag.svg)
```

...or with regular HTML, if you need to set the image size:

```html
<img src="tutorial-assets/T0001L01-dag.svg" width="300px" height="150px" />
```

##### Exercise text file (skip for text-only and multiple-choice lessons)

If your lesson includes a coding exercise, create a second `.md` file and add the markdown-formatted text that provides the assignment text for the exercise box. The name of this file should match the 2-digit lesson number used previously, with `-exercise` appended.

For example (for Lesson 01 of Tutorial 0005):

```
src/tutorials/0005/01-exercise.md
```

##### Useful concepts text file (optional)

Occasionally you may want to add a _useful concepts_ box defining key terminology, if this can't easily be done in-line. If you'd like to do this, create another `.md` file that provides the text for that _useful concepts_ box. The name of this file should match the 2-digit lesson number used previously, with `-concepts` appended. (This step is optional.)

For example (for Lesson 01 of Tutorial 0005):

```
src/tutorials/0005/01-concepts.md
```

#### Create multiple-choice quizzes in your Vue file (skip for coding exercises and text-only lessons)

When creating a multiple-choice lesson, you'll use your Vue file to define the question and its answer choices.

The `question` value must be a string:

```js
const question = "What's the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?"
```

 The `choices` variable must be an array of objects, one for each answer the learner may select. Each object in the array must contain three keys and their respective values:
 - `answer` (a string)
 - `correct` (a boolean: `true` if the answer is correct and `false` if it's wrong)
 - `feedback` (a string displaying a helpful error message for a wrong answer or a congratulatory message for a correct answer)

```js
 const choices = [
   {
     answer: 'An incorrect answer',
     correct: false,
     feedback: 'Oops. Here\'s some clue about why that answer is wrong.'
   },
   {
     answer: 'A correct answer.',
     correct: true,
     feedback: 'Great job!'
   },
   {
     answer: 'A different incorrect answer',
     correct: false,
     feedback: 'Sorry, here\'s some clue about why this choice is wrong.'
   }
 ]
 ```

Please provide 3-5 answer choices per question. **You may only provide _one_ correct choice.**

The answer choices will be presented in the order in which you list them. Be sure to vary the position of the correct answer from lesson to lesson.

The `feedback` provided for each choice will be shown highlighted in red if incorrect or in green if correct, and the user will be able to advance to next lesson once they've made the right selection.

#### Build code challenges and validation in your Vue file (skip for text-only and multiple-choice lessons)

If you are creating a lesson with a code challenge (whether or not it requires file upload), you'll need to provide default code and set up validation in the lesson's Vue file. The basic template you need to accomplish this is provided in the boilerplate file you selected earlier.

##### Provide the starting code for your exercise

`code` is a string property. The value you set for `code` in your Vue file will
be used to populate the code
editor when the user first visits the page. (If you forget to set this, a default
will be used, but your exercise won't be very useful!)

```js
const code = `const run = async () => {
  /* your code here */
}
return run
`
```

Your default `code` will always have this exterior `run` function, inside of which
your user creates their own code. The code your user writes will almost always
include returning a value from the interior function.

As you decide what starting code to provide for each lesson, think about how you
can isolate the action the user needs to take to a single step, representing the
concept they've learned in this particular lesson.

In practice, most lessons build off of previous ones, and code is repeated and
built on between exercises. You will often need to pre-populate in your lesson the
correct solution to a previous lesson or lessons, so that the current exercise can
test adding only the most recent method taught.

You should also think about how you might provide support for programming language
challenges and limit the assignment to executing methods that practice your lesson
content.

Remember that you can add comments to your default code to orient the user, such as:

```js
// your code goes here
```

##### Provide the simplest solution to your exercise

`solution` is a string property. The value you set for `solution` in your Vue
file will be used to populate the code editor if the user clicks the "View
Solution" option. (We hope you'll have provided enough clues that they won't need to do this!)

Be sure to test your solution code. If the user clicks "View Solution" and then "Submit", they should see your success message.

There's almost always more than one way to solve a coding challenge. Although your
validation code (see below) should allow all reasonable solutions to pass, the
`solution` code you provide should be the most straightforward option which
requires the least thorough understanding of JavaScript.

##### Validate the user's submitted code

Feedback is key to a positive learning experience. As the author of a tutorial, you'll need to give careful thought both to how you'll verify that your user has submitted successful code and to what mistakes they might make along the way. It's your responsibility to anticipate challenges and provide helpful clues accordingly.

To do this, you'll use the `validate` function found in the boilerplate, which takes this format:

`validate(result, ipfs)`

When the sample code area is evaluated, it must return a function, usually an
async function. The result of that function is passed to your validation
function as `result`.

Each time the user's code is evaluated, they get a new, clean, IPFS instance.
That instance is passed as the second argument, `ipfs`.

You may want to use both the `result` and `ipfs` values when building conditional statements to evaluate the success or failure of the user's code submission. If needed, check out this primer on [using conditionals in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals).

###### Work with uploaded files (for file upload lessons only)

By using the `FileLesson` component, which comes included in the `boilerplate-file-upload.vue` template, you can create a lesson which requires the user to upload files before completing a code challenge.

![screenshot](public/file_upload.png)

The `run` function in the code challenge takes an argument `files`, which is the array of uploaded files.

```js
const run = async (files) => {
  /* remove the '//' on the line below to complete this challenge */
}
```

Behind the scenes, the uploaded files have been saved as `window.uploadedFiles` for use both in your user's code and in your own validation. In your `validate` function, we recommend saving the files to a variable and allowing for the fact that they may not be present. For example:

```js
const uploadedFiles = window.uploadedFiles || false
```

Remember that these files are stored as browser file objects. Reference the [Files documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File#Properties) to see what properties are available to both you and the user, including `name` and `type`.

If the user proceeds to the next lesson without refreshing their browser, the same files will remain available to them. However, they may also choose to click "Start Over" and upload different files. The user will be unable to click "Submit" until files have either been selected from their machine or carried over from a previous lesson.

###### Create success and failure messages

Your `validate` function must return an object with one of two properties: `fail` or
`success`. Each property should be used to give a detailed message (as a string) either congratulating the user or explaining *why*
the sample code failed in order to help the user along.

```js
const validate = async (result, ipfs) => {
  if (!result) {
    return { fail: 'You forgot to return a result :)' }
  } else if (result) {
    return { success: 'Happy Message!' }
  } else {
    return { fail: 'Sad but useful message :(' }
  }
}
```

Be sure to include conditionals that will catch common mistakes and provide useful clues.

If the object returned by your `validate` function has the property `fail`, the message string you've provided will be shown highlighted in red, and the user will have the opportunity to update and resubmit their code. If it has the property `success`, the user will see the success message highlighted in green, and the "Submit" button will change into a "Next" button allowing them to advance to the next lesson.

If this is the last lesson in your tutorial, the user will see a "More Tutorials" button instead of a "Next" button. Please create a success message for your last lesson that notes that the user has completed the whole tutorial. For example, `Great job! You've completed this series of lessons!`)

###### Override external error messages (optional)

As you test your code, you may notice that you see error messages appear that are different from the ones you provided in your `validate` function. These might include syntax errors noted by our embedded code editor or errors returned by the IPFS API, both of which appear by default. Syntax errors can be very helpful for your user, and other errors might help you identify common errors you hadn't thought of.

If you'd like to replace a specific error message returned automatically with a more user-friendly message created by you, add the attribute
`:overrideErrors="true"` to the Lesson (or FileLesson) component at the start of your Vue file like so:

```js
<Lesson // or FileLesson
    :overrideErrors="true"
    ...
/>
```

Within the `validate` function, add cases for the specific error messages
you need to override, as in this example:

```js
} else if (result instanceof Error && result.message === 'No child name passed to addLink') {
  // Forgot the file name and just used a directory as the path
  return { fail: 'Uh oh. It looks like you created a directory instead of a file. Did you forget to include a filename in your path?' }
}
```

You may choose to use markdown formatting in your responses.

Be sure to adapt your test case so that it works within the context of your other conditionals to meet your validation needs. What is required is that you return an object with the `fail` key and a string as its value; that string is what will be shown to the user.

If you don't return anything from your custom validation and running the users' solution caused an Error to be thrown, it'll be shown to the user, otherwise a default error message will be shown asking them to reset their solution text and try again.

Your custom validation should not throw an error - if it does the default error message will be shown to the user asking them to reset their solution and try again.

Note that most tutorial lessons will _not_ require the overriding of external
errors. If you have questions about whether to use this optional feature, please reach
out to the project maintainers for guidance.

You may (optionally) use [markdown formatting](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) in your `fail` or `success` messages. For example, the following validation code:

```js
} else if (!!result & !result.hash) {
  return { fail: "That result doesn't look right. Are you sure you ran the `stat` method on your empty root directory?" }
}
```

...would produce this user-facing message:

![screenshot](public/markdown_error.png)

###### Display results to the user (optional)

When the user submits their code successfully, they'll receive a success message you've provided in your `validate` function (see above). If you'd like to also show some data to the user to help them understand the results of their code, it's possible to add an additional step after code submission.

In the `validate` function, when returning either a `fail` or a `success`, you can optionally add `log` and `logDesc` keys with values, as in this example:

```js
const ipfsFiles = ipfs.files.ls('/foo')

if (result === 'foo') {
  return { success: 'Happy Message!' }
} else if (result === 'bar') {
  return {
    success: 'You did it!', // A string, which can optionally include markdown formatting
    logDesc: 'Check out the current value of `CID`:', // A description of the data you're displaying (a string, which can optionally include markdown formatting)
    log: ipfsFiles // The data you want the user to see (a JSON object or a string)
  }
} else {
  return { fail: 'Sad but useful message :(' }
}
```

When you use this option, a new section will appear below the exercise box, showing your `logDesc` message followed by the `log` data.

Note that you may (optionally) use [markdown formatting](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) in both your `fail` or `success` values and your `logDesc` value. For example, the following validation code:

```js
return {
  fail: 'Looks like you edited the `ls` code to list something other than the root directory. Please try again, editing only the section of code indicated.',
  logDesc: 'Here\'s what your `ls` command shows' + returnedDirectoryMsg + ':',
  log: JSON.stringify(result, null, 2)
}
```

... would produce this formatted result for the user:

![screenshot](public/markdown_error_logdesc_log.png)


### Manage your tutorial's metadata and routing

There are a few administrative steps you need to take to ensure that all of your lessons appear on our site, along with a landing page and resources page.

Note that you won't be able to preview your lessons until your routing is set up, so you'll need to refer to this section regularly during your development.

#### Add your tutorial to `static/tutorials.json`

In `static/tutorials.json`, add a new key for your tutorial and fill in the appropriate values, as in the example below.

```json
"0005": {
  "url": "short-tutorial-title",
  "project": "IPFS",
  "title": "Your short tutorial title",
  "description": "Your tutorial description",
  "lessons": [
    "Title of 1st lesson",
    "Title of 2nd lesson",
    "Title of 3rd lesson"
  ],
  "resources": [
    {
      "title": "Website 1",
      "link": "https://domain.io",
      "type": "website",
      "description": "Sample description"
    },
    {
      "title": "Documentation 1",
      "link": "https://docs.domain.io",
      "type": "docs"
    }
  ]
},
```

The _key_ must match your tutorial's ID and the name of the directory where you've been creating your files.

The `title` of your tutorial will be seen in course listings on our tutorials page, your tutorial's table of contents, and anywhere else your tutorial is featured.

![screenshot](public/title-in-toc.png)

![screenshot](public/title-in-featured-tutorials.png)

The `url` will appear in the URL of your tutorial landing page and lessons. For example,  `http://proto.school/#/short-tutorial-title/01`. In most cases this will match your tutorial title, but you may find that you need to make it shorter. Note that this URL will also be used to create the abbreviated title that is shown in the breadcrumb navigation and the small header at the top of each page of your tutorial.

![screenshot](public/url-breadcrumb-header.png)

`lessons` is an array of titles (strings) for each of the lessons in your tutorial. Be sure to list these in order. Each title will automatically appear at the top of the appropriate lesson. (Notice that although you will need to include routes for your landing page and resources page in `main.js` as described below, you do _not_ need to include either in this `lessons` array.)

Pay special attention to the `resources` array shown above, which will be used to create a pre-styled `Resources` page at the end of your tutorial. Each object in this array represents one recommended resource, and should include a `title`, `link`, `type` (which appears as a tag), and optional `description` of that resource. The details you provide will be automatically populated into your `Resources` lesson, as in the example below:

![screenshot](public/resources.png)


#### Add your tutorial to `static/courses.json`

In `static/courses.json`, add the tutorial key that you used in `static/tutorials.json` to the `all` array so it will appear in the Tutorials page. For example, to continue with the same example shown above, you would change this:

```json
{
  "all": ["0001", "0002", "0003"],
  "featured": ["0001", "0002", "0003"]
}
```

...to this:

```json
{
  "all": ["0001", "0002", "0003", "0005"],
  "featured": ["0001", "0002", "0003"]
}
```

The project maintainers will take care of making any updates needed to ensure your project is featured in any relevant course listings elsewhere on our site.

#### Update routes and import statements in `src/main.js`

To ensure your lessons appear on the website (and in your local preview), you'll need to add routes and import statements for each lesson in `src/main.js`.

First, import each of your lesson components, naming them according to this pattern:

T<4-digit-tutorial-id>L<2-digit-lesson-number>

For example, the imports for the first 2 lessons of the tutorial with ID 0005 would look like this:
```js
import T0005L01 from './tutorials/0005/01.vue' // Tutorial 0005 - Lesson 01
import T0005L02 from './tutorials/0005/02.vue' // Tutorial 0005 - Lesson 02
```

Now you'll need to create routes for your tutorial's landing page, resources page, and each of its lessons.

Start by adding a route for your tutorial's landing page, which will display a table of contents and show the user's progress, and its resources page, which will link users to external resources or other ProtoSchool tutorials where they can learn more about the subject you've covered. (Notice that the `path` here incorporates the string you provided as the `url` in `src/tutorials.json`, and the `tutorialId` must match the key you used there.)

```js
{ path: '/short-lesson-title', component: Landing, props: { tutorialId: '0005' } },
{ path: '/short-tutorial-title/resources', component: ResourcesLesson, props: { tutorialId: '0005' } },
```

Then add routes for each of your lessons, matching the `path` to the `url` you defined in `src/tutorials.json` and the component name to the import statement you created:

```js
{ path: '/short-tutorial-title/01', component: T0005L01 },
{ path: '/short-tutorial-title/02', component: T0005L02 },
```

When adding your lesson routes, it's important that you follow the existing naming
convention, since the code used elsewhere will parse the routes to determine the
URL of the tutorial (which you defined in `src/tutorials.json`), the current lesson number, and the total number of
lessons in your tutorial.

For example, if you added the routes indicated in the above examples, the second lesson of your tutorial would display the following above the lesson title:

`Short Tutorial Title | Lesson 2 of 2`

If you added 4 lessons with the following routes:

```js
{ path: '/data-structures/01', component: T0001L01 },
{ path: '/data-structures/02', component: T0001L02 },
{ path: '/data-structures/03', component: T0001L03 },
{ path: '/data-structures/04', component: T0001L04 },
```

the third lesson would display the following above the lesson title:

`Data Structures | Lesson 3 of 4`

## Troubleshooting

### Clearing cached data from localStorage

In order to save the user's progress as they work, ProtoSchool uses [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to save cached code and lesson state between visits. This feature works when the user visits the site repeatedly in the same web browser, so long as they aren't using incognito or private mode. Although this solution doesn't work across browsers (a user would see a different history in Chrome than in Firefox, for example), we find that it enables us to provide a nicely customized experience for most users without requiring a login.

On occasion, while developing a lesson, you may want to view the site as though you're a first-time visitor for testing purposes. To do this, you have a few options:
- Open the site in an incognito or private window using your normal web browser
- Open the site in a web browser you haven't used before (Firefox if you normally use Chrome, etc.)
- Clear the localStorage in your main browser by opening the console in your inspector and entering the command `localStorage.clear()`, then refreshing your browser.

Note that your user history on the live website (https://proto.school) is different from that in your local testing environment (localhost), so deleting your cache in the development environment won't affect your history on the live site.

### Renaming a tutorial after it has been published

On rare occassion, we may need to change the name of a tutorial, and its related URL, after it has been published. Because we use IDs as our primary point of reference and have built a migration tool for the cache, it's possible to do this without affecting the user's progress indicators.

To change a tutorial's name, go to its entry in `static/tutorials.json` and update its `title` and `url`. Remember that the URL you use will be converted into a shortened title displayed at the top of each lesson. (For example, the URL `short-tutorial-title` would create the header  `Short Tutorial Title | Lesson 2 of 3` above the title for its second lesson.)

```js
"0005": {
  "url": "new-short-tutorial-title",
  "project": "IPFS",
  "title": "New name of this tutorial",
  "description": "Description of tutorial",
  // etc.
```

Then in the `src/main.js` file, find the routes for your tutorial by its ID (which will remain unchanged) and update the paths to reflect the new `url` value in `static/tutorials.json`:

```js
// Tutorial 0005
{ path: '/new-short-tutorial-title', component: Landing, props: { tutorialId: '0005' } },
{ path: '/new-short-tutorial-title/01', component: T0002L01 },
{ path: '/new-short-tutorial-title/02', component: T0002L02 },
{ path: '/new-short-tutorial-title/03', component: T0002L03 },
{ path: '/new-short-tutorial-title/resources', component: ResourcesLesson, props: { tutorialId: '0005' } },
```

In case someone uses an old link shared with them before the tutorial name and URL were changed, you'll also need to add two redirect objects as follows.

```js
// Tutorial 0005
{ path: '/old-short-tutorial-name', redirect: '/new-short-tutorial-name' },
{ path: '/old-short-tutorial-name/*', redirect: '/new-short-tutorial-name' },
```

Finally, add a new object to the `MIGRATIONS` array, with the tutorial ID (unchaged) and the past URL:

```js
const MIGRATIONS = [
  // { tutorialId: '0003', pastUrl: 'blog' }
  { tutorialId: '0005', pastUrl: 'old-short-tutorial-name' }
]
```

That's it! Next time you run ProtoSchool the tutorial should be renamed and users will still have access to the status of their lesson progress. If a user tries to access the old URL for your tutorial or one of its lessons, they'll be redirected to the tutorial landing page at its new URL.
