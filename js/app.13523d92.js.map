But there's another option. On the\\n<strong>decentralized web</strong>, we can **all** host each other's data,\\nwith a different kind of linking that's more secure, making it easy to\\ntrust our neighbors.\\n\\n## Crytographic hashing\\n\\n<strong>[Cryptographic hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function)</strong> is the most important tool in the toolbox of decentralized data structures. It opens the door to a new form of linking, known as <strong>content\\naddressing</strong>, that liberates us from reliance on central authorities.\\n\\nHashing takes data of any size and type and returns to you a single, fixed-size \\\"hash\\\" that represents it.\\nA hash is a string of characters that looks like gobbledygook, but you can think of it\\nas a unique name for the data. It might look something like this:\\n\\n`zdpuAsHkamdCQgrDrNSwJVgjMkQWoLxdrccxV6qe9htipNein`\\n\\nTo be honest, these names aren't currently very friendly to humans\\n(`beagle.jpg` was so much more descriptive!), but they're a lot more secure. Here's why:\\n\\n<strong>Cryptographic hashes can be derived from the content of the data itself</strong>,\\nmeaning that anyone using the same algorithm on the same data will arrive at the same hash. If Ada and Grace\\nare both using the same decentralized web protocol, such as IPFS, to share the exact\\nsame photo of a kitten, both images will have exactly the same hash. By comparing\\nthose hashes and confirming that they're the same, we can guarantee that every single pixel\\nof those two photos is identical.\\n\\n<strong>Cryptographic hashes are unique</strong>. If Grace uses Photoshop to remove a\\nsingle whisker from that kitty, the updated image will have a new hash. Simply by looking at that hash, even without access to the file itself, it will\\nbe easy to tell that the file now contains different data.\\n\\n## Trust on the decentralized web\\n\\nOn the centralized web, we've learned to trust certain authorities and not others. We do our best\\nwith the clues we have from URLs, but there are some malicious actors who use the shortcomings of location addressing to trick us.\\n\\nOn the decentralized web, though, we all pitch in and host each other's data, and content addressing enables us to trust the information that's shared. We may not know much about the <em>peers</em> who are hosting data, but hashes can prevent malicious actors from deceiving us about the content of files. That's what makes cryptographic hashing so important to the decentralized web.\\n\\n## Asking peers for content\\n\\nWith traditional location addressing, we knew that we needed to visit the domain `puppies.com` to find the\\ncontent stored as `beagle.jpg`. If the `puppies.com` domain were broken for some reason, we'd lose\\naccess to that image.\\n\\nThe decentralized web works differently. When we want a specific photo of an adorable pet, we ask for it\\nby its content address (hash). Who do we ask? The whole network! If Ada is online, we'll see that she has\\nthe content we're looking for, and we'll know that it's exactly the file we need because it has\\na matching hash. If she goes offline, we may still be able to get the same photo from Grace or another peer.\\n\\nSince we use hashes to request data on the decentralized web, we can think of a hash as a link, not just a name.\\n\"","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/ps_symbol_color.0e817003.svg\";","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./FileUpload.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=6ab7b83a&scoped=true&lang=css&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./FileUpload.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=6ab7b83a&scoped=true&lang=css&\"","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Button.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=62ff7903&scoped=true&lang=css&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Button.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=62ff7903&scoped=true&lang=css&\"","module.exports = \"**CID** - Content Identifier.

(Remember,\\nwhen we run data through a cryptographic hash, we get back a \\\"hash\\\" or \\\"content address\\\"\\nthat we can think of as a link, so a Merkle tree is a collection of linked nodes.)\\n\\nAs previously discussed, all content addresses are unique to the data they represent. In the graph above, `node E` contains a reference to the hash for `node F` and `node G`. This means that the content address (hash) of `node E` is unique to a node containing those addresses.\\n\\nGetting lost? Let's imagine this as a set of directories, or file folders. If we run directory E through our hashing algorithm\\nwhile it contains subdirectories F and G, the content-derived hash we get back will include references to those two directories. If we remove directory G, it's like Grace removing that whisker from her kitten photo. Directory E doesn't have the same contents anymore, so it gets a new hash.\\n\\nAs the tree above is built, the final content address (hash) of the root node is unique to a\\ntree that contains every node all the way down this tree. If the data in any node were\\nto change even by a single byte, the hash of the changed node would change, as would the hashes\\nof all of its parent nodes.\\n\\nIn case you haven't noticed, this means that as a programmer you'll always need to build\\nthese data structures backwards, from the leaf nodes on up to the root node.\\n\\n## Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)\\n\\n![img](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Topological_Ordering.svg)\\n\\nDAG is an acronym for \\\"Directed Acyclic Graph.\\\" It's a fancy way of describing a\\nspecific kind of Merkle tree (hash tree) where different branches in the tree can point at other branches\\nin the tree in a single forward direction, as illustrated by the image above.\\n\"","module.exports = \"Let's add some files to IPFS using MFS.

Unlike our other tutorials, this one is\\ncode-free and designed especially to introduce you to some of the key terms you'll\\nencounter throughout ProtoSchool.\\n\\nLet's get started!\\n\\n\\n## What are data structures?\\n\\nWhether you're a programmer or not, you're surrounded by data structures every day. Lists, dictionaries, and catalogs all help us organize information and take into account the relationships between various pieces of data.\\n\\nFrom [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure):\\n\\n> In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.\\n\\nIn programming, data structures are everywhere. The way you organize data into variables in order to use them in programs involves anywhere from dozens to millions of data structures. If you're a developer, you're probably familiar with common data structures like arrays, objects, graphs, etc.\\n\\n## Decentralized data structures\\n\\nOn the decentralized web, where we access data directly from our peers rather than\\nfrom a central authority, we need specialized data structures that allow us to verify\\nand link between various pieces of content.\\n\\nData structures shared through decentralized systems need to be **verifiable**. On a single system such as your own laptop, you have a much greater degree of trust in the data structures you work with in memory\\nor on disk. But in a decentralized system you have less, or possibly zero, trust among peers.\\n\\nLarge data structures must also be able to be spread out among many peers and **linked together** to allow for decentralization. In the same way that any web page can link to another web page\\nin a different location, decentralized data structures enable a web of interlinked data.\\n\"","module.exports = \"\\nSo far we've exclusively been discussing adorable images for the sake of our general\\nmerriment, but content addressing can be used on all different types of files and data,\\nfrom JSON objects to term papers to videos. For cryptographic hashing to work, we need\\nto know what data format we're working with and use an appropriate tool.\\n\\n## Decoding data structures\\n\\nA `CID` (Content Identifier) is a particular form of content addressing used on the decentralized web. It was developed for\\nIPFS (a decentralized web protocol which we'll discuss in later tutorials), but has very broad implications.\\n\\nA `CID` is a single identifier that contains both a cryptographic hash **and**\\na \\\"codec,\\\" which holds information about how to interpret that data. Codecs encode and\\ndecode data in certain formats.\\n\\n```\\n+-------+------------------------------+\\n| Codec | Multihash                    |\\n+-------+------------------------------+\\n```\\n\\nMany formats and protocols use content addressing already. Tools like Git and protocols like Ethereum and Bitcoin are among them, but they differ in how to interpret the data and in what cryptographic function they use for hashing. `CID` allows us to create a universal identifier for any of these systems.\\n\\nEvery `CID` is an identifier that contains the `codec` to interpret the data and a `multihash` which is a self-describing hash (a hash that tells you what type of hashing function was used to create it).\\n\\n```\\n+------------------------------+\\n| Codec                        |\\n+------------------------------+\\n|                              |\\n| Multihash                    |\\n| +----------+---------------+ |\\n| |Hash Type | Hash Value    | |\\n| +----------+---------------+ |\\n|                              |\\n+------------------------------+\\n```\\n\\n## Linking between different data structures\\n\\n`CID`s allow us to build data structures that link to other data structures\\nin completely different formats. Imagine a tree of JSON objects that link\\nto BSON objects that also link to git commits. (Or imagine a directory containing\\npuppy images <em>and</em> kitty videos, with a subdirectory containing articles on\\ngiraffes. The possiblities are endless!) All the way down this tree we\\nhave cryptographic hashes that allow us to distribute and link the data.\\n\\nWhy is it important to link between different data structures?

As its full name suggests, you can think of IPFS as a file system, and it has some unique characteristics that make it ideal for safe, decentralized sharing.\\n\\nIf you haven't yet done so, we encourage you to check out our [Decentralized Data Structures tutorial](https://proto.school/#/data-structures/), where you can learn all about the decentralized web and how it compares to the web you're accustomed to. There you'll learn all about content addressing, cryptographic hashing, Content Identifiers (CIDs), and sharing with peers, all of which you'll need to understand to make the most of this tutorial on IPFS.\\n\\n## Storing and sharing data in IPFS\\n\\nWhere does content live when it's added to the IPFS network?\\n\\nAs a peer-to-peer data storage system, IPFS allows each user (peer) to host whatever data they'd like locally. When you first add new content to IPFS, you're really just setting it up on your own machine in a format suitable for sharing via the IPFS protocol. Typically you'd install IPFS on your own computer and create a new instance of IPFS (also known as a node) there. That's where your data would live locally, referenced by content addresses (CIDs). Data stored in IPFS can take many forms, but one of the most common use cases is the sharing of traditional files, which we'll learn more about in this tutorial.\\n\\nYou could choose to share your data or files with your peers when you had a network connection, but if you were the only one hosting a particular resource, it would become unavailable to your peers when your machine went offline. Having multiple peers hosting the same files is what makes them more readily available, and using CIDs (unique content identifiers created through cryptograhpic hashing) is what makes this system secure. We'll talk more about sharing in future tutorials, but for now we'll focus on how to work with files within your own IPFS instance.\\n\\n## Mutable File System\\nBecause files in IPFS are content-addressed and immutable, you can't edit files; instead, a new file is created with every change. The **Mutable File System (MFS)** is a tool built into IPFS that lets you treat files like you normally would in a name-based filesystem — you can add, remove, move, and edit MFS files and have all the work of updating links and hashes taken care of for you. It's an abstraction that lets you deal with immutable data as if it were mutable.\\n\\nMFS is accessed through the `files` commands in the IPFS CLI (command-line interface) and API. In this tutorial we'll explore the [Files API](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md#the-files-api-aka-mfs-the-mutable-file-system).\\n\\nIf you've worked with files and directories from the command line before, many of the MFS methods will look very familiar!\\n\\nLet's start exploring how we can work with files in IPFS!\\n\"","module.exports = \"When we add a file to MFS using `files.write()`, there's no value returned\\nby the method, but we can still check to ensure everything worked as expected.\\n\\nIn the Mutable File System, we can inspect directories using the `files.ls()`\\nmethod.

They make it possible for us to create links and connect data on the web, so they serve a valuable purpose. (The web would be pretty lousy without links!) However, <strong>URLs are based on the <em>location</em> where data is stored</strong>, not on the contents of the resource stored there. We call this <strong>location addressing</strong>, and it presents us with some problems.\\n\\nMost of us have a lot of experience with URLs, and we make some assumptions about them based on our experience. When we see  `https://www.puppies.com/beagle.jpg`, for example, we'll probably guess from the file name and extension that the data stored at that location is an image of a beagle (in JPEG format), but we can't verify this from the URL alone. There may very well be a photo of a chihuahua hiding at `beagle.jpg`, or even worse, an adorable kitty!\\n\\nThrough the domain name, URLs indicate which *authority* we should go to for the data. Even though the web is already decentralized in a sense (since anyone can link to anyone else), the links referencing the data are location-based, so the data itself must be centralized on an authority in order for us to find it. We make assumptions about these authorities (or domains), just as we do with file names. For example, we might assume that a file hosted at `puppies.com` is safer to open than one hosted at `evilhacker.com`, but we can't be sure of it.\\n\\nUltimately, the contents of a file hosted on the centralized web have no direct relationship with their location-based addresses. If we see a picture of an adorable puppy and are told it's stored on the web, there's no way for us to guess the URL that would lead us to the image. We can determine neither the domain, which tells us who's hosting it, nor the filename.\\n\\n## Trust and efficiency on the centralized web\\nSince we can't verify what content resides at a particular URL and are dependent on central authorities (and human kindess) to label things as they really are, it's easy for us to get tricked by malicious actors.\\n\\nIt's also easy for 42,000 people to store exactly the same photo of that adorable beagle, but all on different domains and with different filenames, leading to a lot of redundancy. Let's face it, even on our own laptops most of us have accidentally saved the same document as `download.pdf` and `download(01).pdf` without realizing it, or saved iterations of the same term paper over and over again with `v1` or `2018-12-18` added to the title. The web is a confusing mess of data that's saved multiple times at different URLs, and there's no easy way to tell which items are identical to each other.\\n\\nThere must be a better way!\\n\"","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Chapters.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=f89e4ad6&scoped=true&lang=css&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Chapters.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=f89e4ad6&scoped=true&lang=css&\"","module.exports = \"One important feature of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) is the ability to link them together.\\n\\nThe way you express links in the `ipfs` DAG store is with the `CID` of\\nanother node.\\n\\nFor example, one node might have a link called `foo` pointed\\nto another CID instance previously saved as `barCid`, like so:\\n\\n```javascript\\n{\\n  foo: barCid\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhen we give a field a name and make its value a link to a CID, as shown above,\\nwe call this a **named link**.\\n\\nWe can add named links to IPFS in the same way we add any other data:\\n\\n```javascript\\nawait ipfs.dag.put({ foo: barCid })\\n```\\n\"","module.exports = \"You want to create an overview page that lists your blog posts chronologically.\\n\\nYou *could* do it the same way as we did with tags.

Whenever you create a new blog post, you can link to the previous one directly. This enables you to walk those links to create the chronological overview page dynamically, as we'll see in the next lesson.\\n\\nWe know the CID of a blog post as soon as it is stored in IPFS.

Whenever you see `ipfs.someMethod()` in our lessons, `ipfs` is a variable that refers to your IPFS instance, also known as a node. The actions that you take only affect your own IPFS node, not nodes belonging to your peers.\\n\\nWe're creating your IPFS node behind the scenes so you can focus on the content of our lessons, but eventually you'll need to learn to host your own node locally by installing IPFS and running a daemon in your terminal. When you're ready to experiment, you can find instructions for [installing IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/install/) and [initializing your node](https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/usage/) in our docs.\\n\\nAs mentioned previously, methods associated with the Mutable File System are part of the Files API, so they'll take the format of `ipfs.files.someMethod()`. Let's take a look at a simple method you can start using even before you've added any files to your IPFS node.\\n\\n## Exploring your IPFS node with `ipfs.files.stat`\\nWhen working with your IPFS node, you'll often want to check the status of a file or directory. You can do this with `ipfs.files.stat`, passing in the path you'd like to check on.\\n\\nFor example, to check the status of a directory called `stuff` located within our root directory ( `/` ), we could call the method like so:\\n\\n`await ipfs.files.stat('/stuff')`\\n\\nThis method returns an object with some essential data about our file or directory:\\n\\n* **hash** (a string with the cryptographic hash)\\n* **size** (an integer with the file or directory size in Bytes)\\n* **cumulativeSize** (an integer with the size of the DAGNodes making up the file in Bytes)\\n* **type** (a string that can be either `directory` or `file`)\\n* **blocks** (if type is `directory`, this is the number of files in the directory; if type is `file`, it's the number of blocks that make up the file)\\n* **withLocality** (a boolean to indicate if locality information are present)\\n* **local** (a boolean to indicate if the queried dag is fully present locally)\\n* **sizeLocal** (an integer indicating the cumulative size of the data present locally)\\n\\n*Gotcha!* The `size` of a directory is always `0`, no matter how many entries it contains, since directories are really just a set of links to other files and directories. A directory's `cumulativeSize`, by contrast, changes as the directory's contents change. It represents not just the file sizes of all the entries in that directory, but also the metadata that describes those entries: types, block sizes and so on.\\n\\nIt's important to note that you can `stat` your IPFS node even when you don't have anything in it yet.
